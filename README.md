# CoCo.Disassemblies

This is a collection of disassembly information files for f9dasm and compatible disassemblers. They are a work in progress and far from complete but include information files for the following binaries:

1. Audio Spectrum Analyzer for the Color Computer 1 and 2.
2. Color Baseball for the Color Computer 1, 2, and 3.
3. Buzzard Bait with Color Computer 3 patch.
4. Digger I for the Color Computer 3

That is all.
